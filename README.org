* Org for todos, agenda and notes

The main use I have right now for org mode
is to manage my agenda, todos, and notes
of all kinds.

This repo holds the files I used
for the purposes mentioned earlier,
plus some other configuration files.

* A bit more in depth

** Keeping track of things

My usual workflow is to check my to-dos with =C-c a t=,
which opens a window with everything I've marked =TODO= in my Org files.
Also, the agenda help with things that I need to get done for a specific date.
My usage of this is very basic.

* Regarding the License

Maybe the GPL is not the absolute best for this type of work,
but it does no harm to have it.
