1 Question on the poem.
═══════════════════════

  After \(x=y^2-kt\) reading the poem and the different comments on it, what do you
  consider Walcott is expressing in his poem and why do you think he
  feels that way? Make references to the poem in your answer.(Answer in
  a paragraph.)

           \( x ∧ p = y ∨ u\)
  
  \(\implies \text{<a hint>}\)
  
  \(x \lor q \lor k\)

2 Answer
════════

  I believe Walcott is trying to express a deep sentiment of division
  within himself.  He has, on one side, his African heritage and, on the
  other, is British colonial heritage:

  		  (Lines 27-28 about inner division)
  	      I who am poisoned with the blood of both,
  	       Where shall I turn, divided to the vein?

  Both compel him, for he loves the english tongue and dislikes english
  culture, and he feels compassion for the African tribes although he
  dislikes their savagery.  He both commodes the horrors of the ruthless
  colonial and the African tribesmen:

  		    (Lines 6,7 about the British)
  	      Only the worm, colonel of carrion, cries:
  	    "Waste no compassion on these separate dead!"

  		   (Lines 19,20 about the African)
  	     Delirious as these worried beasts, his wars
  	      Dance to the tightened carcass of a drum,
