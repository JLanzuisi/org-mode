* Describe Annie and Mrs. Rogers.
Annie and Mrs. Rogers are two old women,
who knew each other and are,
according to the events portrayed in the play by cite:nla.cat-vn2311401,
meeting again after many years.

Annie appears wearing her old church dress `shabby but clean',
as is described in the play.
Mrs. Rogers, on the other hand, is wearing house slippers and has her hair in curlers.

Annie also seems to be slimmer than Mrs. Rogers,
who is described as `looking fat'. 

* Why has Annie gone to their house?
Annie is finding herself in difficult times,
she has a nephew to take care of and very little money to do so.
Her job doesn't pay well enough,
so she has come to Mrs. and Mr. Rogers, her past employers,
to ask for a bit of help.

* What is Mrs. Rogers attitude towards her?
Mostly dismissive, like trying to get Annie to leave as soon as possible.
Mrs. Rogers gets irritated easily,
probably because she doesn't give much importance to the problems of her old maid.
This attitude coupled with the one Mr. Roger has,
proves how little they care for someone who they consider not worth even remembering.

* Do you notice any difference in the way they speak?
Yes, Annie speaks in a less articulate way. 
She misspells or gives words different spellings than usual.
This is likely because she hasn't had any formal education,
and thus English is not a language she has studied.
It's rather something she has picked up from usage and need.

Mrs. Rogers is in this regard the opposite,
she speaks well and correctly.
Being from an upper class, compared to Annie, this is no surprise.

* Describe the differences between Jean and Carlton.
Aside from the obvious physical differences,
that Jean is a teenage girl and Carlton a small boy,
there are social differences.

For starters, Jean is part of a different social strata,
so she'll likely be better off in life simply because she was born in the right family.
Carlton is not only poor but an orphan,
her custodian (Annie) is likely to not make enough money for both of them,
so he has to work at a young age, in precarious and dangerous conditions.
In this sense, they're as far apart as can be.

* Why do you think the play is called Return to Paradise?
I'm not sure.
In one superficial sense it could be because Annie seems to like the place so much,
she thinks it's so beautiful and all that.

But I think it must be ironic,
the place she is returning to is not paradise:
she, and her nephew, would have been treated as subhuman,
disposable at any moment.
In this sense the clear class divide does not describe a paradise,
it rather describes the opposite:
