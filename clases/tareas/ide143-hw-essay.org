* Racism & poverty in the Caribbean

The region of the Caribbean, formed by more than seven hundred islands cite:noauthor_caribbean_2021,
is marked by inequality and the consequences of colonial rule.
In this, it has a lot in common with many other countries of south and central America.
Guided by three literary pieces of the Caribbean,
comprising the period 1962-1989,
these problems of inequality and racism will be explored.
The images depicted in said works will be central to the explanation.

We'll shortly examine carefully a play, by Cicely WaiteSmith cite:waite1966return,
a short story, by Olive Senior cite:senior_arrival_2009, and a poem, by Derek Walcott cite:walcott_africa.
The two former were Jamaican writers while the later was Saint Lucian.
With these works, and the insight they provide,
we'll be able to take a close look at the inner workings of their respective societies,
and of the Caribbean as a whole.

* These problems, depicted in literary works

In the play /Return to paradise/, we are treated to a poor working class women, named Annie,
that has to come back to the house of her former employees, where she used to work as a maid,
to ask for work.
This first point of contact with the Caribbean, trough the play,
tells us how this woman is dismissed and rejected by her old employees,
both being considerably better off than Annie. 

The play is an interesting starting place,
first it sets up the tone of silent racism and classism
that'll become more apparent in the later works,
as an example of this we could consider this small passage in which
Mr. rogers, one of the employees, can't remember Annie even though she worked for him for many years:
#+BEGIN_quote
MR. ROGERS: (inside) Get me a cool drink, will you?
(casually) By the way, who's the old woman at the back door?

MRS. ROGERS: (inside) Ssh ... Not so loud (their voices jade). cite:waite1966return.
#+END_quote

This last quote, even though it doesn't offend Annie too much,
tells how their former employees thinked of her as background decoration,
as just being there to fulfill a task,
like a broom or a toaster.

The biggest takeaway from the play,
is the contrast between social classes that is depicted,
the absolute tranquility with which the middle class people can
ignore a desperate women who used to be close to them:
#+BEGIN_quote
/(She lifts an anguished face)/ Lord me God ... cite:waite1966return.
#+END_quote

Another important aspect that we'll see depicted again later on
are the horrible conditions in which poor children are force to live and survive,
while their middle-upper class counterparts can grow up carelessly, like children should.

Lastly, Waite-Smith tells us in his play a bit of how the society of 1966
Jamaica looked like.
An image that, unfortunately, is all too familiar for everyone except the most privileged:
a social stratified society, in which human beings can be discarded and dismissed as garbage.

Olive Senior, on /The two grandmothers/,
depicts 1989 Jamaica.
This time, from the point of view of a little girl
whose grandmothers come from two different and opposing worlds:
one is a country old woman, not poor but certainly not rich,
and the other is a middle class city woman.

Senior gives us a coming of age story,
in which the little girl grows apart from her country side grandmother,
and into the racist, classicist, world of her other grandmother.
This short story makes more emphasis on the racist aspect,
as the little girl gets mortified at being called `nigger':
#+BEGIN_quote
You are only a goddamn nigger you don't know any better. cite:senior_arrival_2009
#+END_quote

We see a society in which the color of one skin is central to one's social standing.
Darker skin colors are seen as undesirable, for they mark the bearers of a sort of 'curse'.
There is, of course, no such thing as a curse, only a social and political status quo
that has defined this things and enforces them.

Our little protagonists contrast directly with her best childhood friend,
that lived in the country near her grandmother.
Her friend, being poor, grows up to be just as poor, maybe even more.
She and her brothers wear rags and go hungry, for that was her imposed destiny since the day she was born.
Imposed, of course, by a social system.
Our protagonist, on the other hand, goes to some nice city school,
and is a pretty and well dressed young girl.

The most important thing, to our thesis, of this story by Senior,
is the fact that we live trough our protagonist
the transition from a loving and caring little girl to
a prejudiced and dismissive young lady,
that has been completely changed by the racist society she lives in.
This reinforces the fact that the Caribbean is composed of mostly broken
and malfunctioning societies,
exceptions of which are few and far between.

So far, our selected works of literature
have confirmed our early depiction of the Caribbean.
And have shown an image of division and poverty,
of inequality and injustice.
They also have depicted a living, real, society,
in which there's some sort of hope for decency,
usually in the side of the poor.

Walcotts poem, /A far cry from Africa/,
situates us on Africa, away from the Caribbean.
In this poem he responds to ``the Mau Mau Uprising in Kenya, 
a guerrilla war fought by native Kenyans against British colonists from 1952-1960" cite:noauthor_litcharts_nodate.

The author, even thought he's speaking of Africa,
is also speaking of his Saint Lucian homeland
which is under English control from 1814 onward cite:noauthor_saint_2021.
In this poem we see his internal struggle,
he feels torn apart between the english tongue that he loves,
and the rightful fight for independence and justice,
whether it be local or abroad.

The poems depicts the acts of cruelty of the colonists,
as well as the gruesome carnage the Kenyan,
and any oppressed people for that matter,
can cause in order to be free.

* The twentieth century Caribbean

Our journey so far has depicted an usual picture.
A picture that defined the twentieth century.
That of poverty and revolution,
of social distress and inequality.

The period we took literature work from
is a crucial one for the region.
World war II had finished more than a decade ago,
and the world was submerge in the decolonization process,
in Africa and also in the Americas.

The Soviet Union played a major political and military role
in the decolonization,
and the United Stated along with part of Europe
played the role of the colons who where losing ground.

In this landscape the Caribbean appears
injured and, for the most part, alone.
Whether colonial rule, or imposed poverty,
the Caribbean people had to suffer,
and still has.

But there are still some good things to hold on to,
just like the grandmother of Senior's story
who keep helping the poor even thought she couldn't change the world,
our best bet is to try and keep as much of our humanity intact,
that is, of our kindness.
