# Org mode files

This repo contains the org files I use.
Usually these are for my agenda,
configuration files,
and writing in general.

My university homework and classes, for example, are in org mode.
They then get converted to LaTeX if I need to share them.

# Configuration files

I'm trying to migrate all my configuration files
(emacs configuration, LaTeX preambles, etc)
to org files.

This allows for more organized and better documented source code.
These org files get tangled into the correct files,
so I only include the org files in the repo.

# Regarding the License

Maybe the GPL is not the absolute best for this type of work,
but it does no harm to have it.

I do believe free software to be important enough to make the effort to license correctly everything I do that can be remotly considered software.
